# âš¾ MLB Roster Lookup Tool

A simple widget created in React that pulls data from an MLB endpoint. It allows you to view the historical rosters for individual teams by season, plus filter the roster by position, and highlight specific player details. The original idea behind this was to create an interactive cheat sheet for the [MLB Pickle](https://mlbpickle.com/) game.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

All data displayed in this widget is copyright by MLB Advanced Media, L.P.
